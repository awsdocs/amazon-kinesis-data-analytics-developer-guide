# Step 4 \(Optional\) Edit the Schema and SQL Code Using the Console<a name="console-feature-summary"></a>

**Warning**  
For new projects, we recommend that you use the new Kinesis Data Analytics Studio over Kinesis Data Analytics for SQL Applications\. Kinesis Data Analytics Studio combines ease of use with advanced analytical capabilities, enabling you to build sophisticated stream processing applications in minutes\.

Following, you can find information about how to edit an inferred schema and how to edit SQL code for Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics\. You do so by working with the schema editor and SQL editor that are part of the Kinesis Data Analytics console\. 

**Note**  
To access or sample data in the console, your login user's role must have the `kinesisanalytics:GetApplicationState` permission\. For more information about Kinesis Data Analytics application permissions, see [Overview of Managing Access](access-control-overview.md)\.

# Monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch<a name="monitoring-cloudwatch"></a>

**Warning**  
For new projects, we recommend that you use the new Kinesis Data Analytics Studio over Kinesis Data Analytics for SQL Applications\. Kinesis Data Analytics Studio combines ease of use with advanced analytical capabilities, enabling you to build sophisticated stream processing applications in minutes\.

You can monitor Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics applications using Amazon CloudWatch\. CloudWatch collects and processes raw data from Kinesis Data Analytics into readable, near real\-time metrics\. These statistics are retained for a period of two weeks\. You can access the historical information and gain a better perspective on how your web application or service is performing\. By default, Kinesis Data Analytics metric data is automatically sent to CloudWatch\. For more information, see [What Is Amazon CloudWatch?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

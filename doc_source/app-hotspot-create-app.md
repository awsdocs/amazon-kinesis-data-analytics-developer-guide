# Step 2: Create the Kinesis Data Analytics Application<a name="app-hotspot-create-app"></a>

**Warning**  
For new projects, we recommend that you use the new Kinesis Data Analytics Studio over Kinesis Data Analytics for SQL Applications\. Kinesis Data Analytics Studio combines ease of use with advanced analytical capabilities, enabling you to build sophisticated stream processing applications in minutes\.

In this section of the [Hotspots example](app-hotspots-detection.md), you create an Amazon Kinesis data analytics application as follows:
+ Configure the application input to use the Kinesis data stream you created as the streaming source in [Step 1](app-hotspots-prepare.md)\.
+ Use the provided application code in the AWS Management Console\.

**To create an application**

1. Create a Kinesis data analytics application by following steps 1, 2, and 3 in the [Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/get-started-exercise.html) exercise \(see [Step 3\.1: Create an Application](get-started-create-app.md)\)\.

   In the source configuration, do the following:
   + Specify the streaming source you created in [Step 1: Create the Input and Output Streams](app-hotspots-prepare.md)\.
   + After the console infers the schema, edit the schema\. Ensure that the `x` and `y` column types are set to `DOUBLE` and that the `IS_HOT` column type is set to `VARCHAR`\. 

1. Use the following application code \(you can paste this code into the SQL editor\):

   ```
   CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM "DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM" (
       "x" DOUBLE, 
       "y" DOUBLE, 
       "is_hot" VARCHAR(4),
       HOTSPOTS_RESULT VARCHAR(10000)
   ); 
   CREATE OR REPLACE PUMP "STREAM_PUMP" AS 
       INSERT INTO "DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM" 
       SELECT "x", "y", "is_hot", "HOTSPOTS_RESULT" 
       FROM TABLE (
           HOTSPOTS(   
               CURSOR(SELECT STREAM "x", "y", "is_hot" FROM "SOURCE_SQL_STREAM_001"), 
               1000, 
               0.2, 
               17)
       );
   ```

   

1. Run the SQL code and review the results\.

# Security Best Practices for Kinesis Data Analytics for Apache Flink<a name="security-best-practices"></a>

Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics provides a number of security features to consider as you develop and implement your own security policies\. The following best practices are general guidelines and donâ€™t represent a complete security solution\. Because these best practices might not be appropriate or sufficient for your environment, treat them as helpful considerations rather than prescriptions\. 

## Implement least privilege access<a name="security-best-practices-privileges"></a>

When granting permissions, you decide who is getting what permissions to which Kinesis Data Analytics resources\. You enable specific actions that you want to allow on those resources\. Therefore you should grant only the permissions that are required to perform a task\. Implementing least privilege access is fundamental in reducing security risk and the impact that could result from errors or malicious intent\. 

## Use IAM roles to access other Amazon services<a name="security-best-practices-roles"></a>

Your Kinesis Data Analytics application must have valid credentials to access resources in other services, such as Kinesis data streams, Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams, or Amazon S3 buckets\. You should not store AWS credentials directly in the application or in an Amazon S3 bucket\. These are long\-term credentials that are not automatically rotated and could have a significant business impact if they are compromised\. 

Instead, you should use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for your application to access other resources\. When you use a role, you don't have to use long\-term credentials to access other resources\.

For more information, see the following topics in the *IAM User Guide*:
+ [IAM Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html)
+ [Common Scenarios for Roles: Users, Applications, and Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios.html)

## Implement Server\-Side Encryption in Dependent Resources<a name="security-best-practices-sse"></a>

Data at rest and data in transit is encrypted in Kinesis Data Analytics, and this encryption cannot be disabled\. You should implement server\-side encryption in your dependent resources, such as Kinesis data streams, Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams, and Amazon S3 buckets\. For more information on implementing server\-side encryption in dependent resources, see [Data Protection](data-protection.md)\.

## Use CloudTrail to Monitor API Calls<a name="security-best-practices-cloudtrail"></a>

Kinesis Data Analytics is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an Amazon service in Kinesis Data Analytics\.

Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine the request that was made to Kinesis Data Analytics, the IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details\.

For more information, see [Logging Kinesis Data Analytics API Calls with AWS CloudTrail](logging-using-cloudtrail.md)\.

# Using Asynchronous I/O in Kinesis Data Analytics for Apache Flink<a name="how-async"></a>

An Asynchronous I/O operator enriches stream data using an external data source such as a database\. Kinesis Data Analytics enriches the stream events asynchronously so that requests can be batched for greater efficiency\. 

For more information, see [Asynchronous I/O](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.15/dev/stream/operators/asyncio.html) in the [Apache Flink Documentation](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.15/)\.

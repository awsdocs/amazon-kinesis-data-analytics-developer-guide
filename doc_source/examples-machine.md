**Warning**  
For new projects, we recommend that you use the new Kinesis Data Analytics Studio over Kinesis Data Analytics for SQL Applications\. Kinesis Data Analytics Studio combines ease of use with advanced analytical capabilities, enabling you to build sophisticated stream processing applications in minutes\.

This section provides examples of Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics applications that use machine learning queries\. Machine learning queries perform complex analysis on data, relying on the history of the data in the stream to find unusual patterns\. The examples provide step\-by\-step instructions to set up and test your Kinesis data analytics application\.

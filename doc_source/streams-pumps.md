# In\-Application Streams and Pumps<a name="streams-pumps"></a>

**Warning**  
For new projects, we recommend that you use the new Kinesis Data Analytics Studio over Kinesis Data Analytics for SQL Applications\. Kinesis Data Analytics Studio combines ease of use with advanced analytical capabilities, enabling you to build sophisticated stream processing applications in minutes\.

When you configure [application input](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/how-it-works-input.html), you map a streaming source to an in\-application stream that is created\. Data continuously flows from the streaming source into the in\-application stream\. An in\-application stream works like a table that you can query using SQL statements, but it's called a stream because it represents continuous data flow\. 

**Note**  
Do not confuse in\-application streams with Amazon Kinesis data streams and Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams\. In\-application streams exist only in the context of an Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics application\. Kinesis data streams and Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams exist independent of your application\. You can configure them as a streaming source in your application input configuration or as a destination in output configuration\.

You can also create more in\-application streams as needed to store intermediate query results\. Creating an in\-application stream is a two\-step process\. First, you create an in\-application stream, and then you pump data into it\. For example, suppose that the input configuration of your application creates an in\-application stream named `INPUTSTREAM`\. In the following example, you create another stream \(`TEMPSTREAM`\), and then you pump data from `INPUTSTREAM` into it\. 

1. Create an in\-application stream \(`TEMPSTREAM`\) with three columns, as shown following:

   ```
   CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM "TEMPSTREAM" ( 
      "column1" BIGINT NOT NULL, 
      "column2" INTEGER, 
      "column3" VARCHAR(64));
   ```

   The column names are specified in quotes, making them case sensitive\. For more information, see [Identifiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/sqlref/sql-reference-identifiers.html) in the *Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics SQL Reference*\.

1. Insert data into the stream using a pump\. A pump is a continuous insert query running that inserts data from one in\-application stream to another in\-application stream\. The following statement creates a pump \(`SAMPLEPUMP`\) and inserts data into the `TEMPSTREAM` by selecting records from another stream \(`INPUTSTREAM`\)\.

   ```
   CREATE OR REPLACE PUMP "SAMPLEPUMP" AS 
   INSERT INTO "TEMPSTREAM" ("column1", 
                             "column2", 
                             "column3") 
   SELECT STREAM inputcolumn1, 
                 inputcolumn2, 
                 inputcolumn3
   FROM "INPUTSTREAM";
   ```

You can have multiple writers insert into an in\-application stream, and there can be multiple readers selected from the stream\. Think of an in\-application stream as implementing a publish/subscribe messaging paradigm\. In this paradigm, the data row, including the time of creation and time of receipt, can be processed, interpreted, and forwarded by a cascade of streaming SQL statements, without having to be stored in a traditional RDBMS\.

After an in\-application stream is created, you can perform normal SQL queries\. 

**Note**  
When you query streams, most SQL statements are bound using a row\-based or time\-based window\. For more information, see [Windowed Queries](windowed-sql.md)\.

You can also join streams\. For examples of joining streams, see [Streaming Data Operations: Stream Joins](stream-joins-concepts.md)\.

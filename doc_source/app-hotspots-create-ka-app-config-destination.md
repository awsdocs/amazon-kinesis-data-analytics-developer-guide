# Step 3: Configure the Application Output<a name="app-hotspots-create-ka-app-config-destination"></a>

**Warning**  
For new projects, we recommend that you use the new Kinesis Data Analytics Studio over Kinesis Data Analytics for SQL Applications\. Kinesis Data Analytics Studio combines ease of use with advanced analytical capabilities, enabling you to build sophisticated stream processing applications in minutes\.

At this point in the [Hotspots example](app-hotspots-detection.md), you have Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics application code discovering significant hotspots from a streaming source and assigning a heat score to each\. 

You can now send the application result from the in\-application stream to an external destination, which is another Kinesis data stream \(`ExampleOutputStream`\)\. You can then analyze the hotspot scores and determine what an appropriate threshold is for hotspot heat\. You can extend this application further to generate alerts\. 

**To configure the application output**

1. Open the Kinesis Data Analytics console at [ https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/kinesisanalytics](https://console.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics)\.

1. In the SQL editor, choose either **Destination** or **Add a destination** in the application dashboard\. 

1. On the **Add a destination** page, choose **Select from your streams**\. Then choose the `ExampleOutputStream` stream that you created in the preceding section\.

   Now you have an external destination, where Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics persists any records, your application writes to the in\-application stream `DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM`\. 

1. You can optionally configure AWS Lambda to monitor the `ExampleOutputStream` stream and send you alerts\. For more information, see [Using a Lambda Function as Output](how-it-works-output-lambda.md)\. You can also review the records that Kinesis Data Analytics writes to the external destination, which is the Kinesis stream `ExampleOutputStream`, as described in [Step 4: Verify the Application Output](app-hotspots-verify-output.md)\.

# Sliding Windows<a name="sliding-window-concepts"></a>

**Warning**  
For new projects, we recommend that you use the new Kinesis Data Analytics Studio over Kinesis Data Analytics for SQL Applications\. Kinesis Data Analytics Studio combines ease of use with advanced analytical capabilities, enabling you to build sophisticated stream processing applications in minutes\.

Instead of grouping records using `GROUP BY`, you can define a time\-based or row\-based window\. You do this by adding an explicit `WINDOW` clause\. 

In this case, as the window slides with time, Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics emits an output when new records appear on the stream\. Kinesis Data Analytics emits this output by processing rows in the window\. Windows can overlap in this type of processing, and a record can be part of multiple windows and be processed with each window\. The following example illustrates a sliding window\.

Consider a simple query that counts records on the stream\. This example assumes a 5\-second window\. In the following example stream, new records arrive at time t1, t2, t6, and t7, and three records arrive at time t8 seconds\.

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/images/sliding-10.png)

Keep the following in mind:
+ The example assumes a 5\-second window\. The 5\-second window slides continuously with time\. 
+ For every row that enters a window, an output row is emitted by the sliding window\. Soon after the application starts, you see the query emit output for every new record that appears on the stream, even though a 5\-second window hasn't passed yet\. For example, the query emits output when a record appears in the first second and second second\. Later, the query processes records in the 5\-second window\.
+ The windows slide with time\. If an old record on the stream falls out of the window, the query doesn't emit output unless there is also a new record on the stream that falls within that 5\-second window\.

  

Suppose that the query starts executing at t0\. Then the following occurs:

1. At the time t0, the query starts\. The query doesn't emit output \(count value\) because there are no records at this time\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/images/sliding-t0.png)

1. At time t1, a new record appears on the stream, and the query emits count value 1\.   
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/images/sliding-t1.png)

1. At time t2, another record appears, and the query emits count 2\.   
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/images/sliding-t2.png)

1. The 5\-second window slides with time:
   + At t3, the sliding window t3 to t0
   + At t4 \(sliding window t4 to t0\)
   + At t5 the sliding window t5–t0

   At all of these times, the 5\-second window has the same records—there are no new records\. Therefore, the query doesn't emit any output\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/images/sliding-t3-4-5.png)

1. At time t6, the 5\-second window is \(t6 to t1\)\. The query detects one new record at t6 so it emits output 2\. The record at t1 is no longer in the window and doesn't count\.   
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/images/sliding-t6.png)

1. At time t7, the 5\-second window is t7 to t2\. The query detects one new record at t7 so it emits output 2\. The record at t2 is no longer in the 5\-second window, and therefore isn't counted\.   
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/images/sliding-t7.png)

1. At time t8, the 5\-second window is t8 to t3\. The query detects three new records, and therefore emits record count 5\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/images/sliding-t8.png)

In summary, the window is a fixed size and slides with time\. The query emits output when new records appear\. 

**Note**  
We recommend that you use a sliding window no longer than one hour\. If you use a longer window, the application takes longer to restart after regular system maintenance\. This is because the source data must be read from the stream again\.

The following example queries use the `WINDOW` clause to define windows and perform aggregates\. Because the queries don't specify `GROUP BY`, the query uses the sliding window approach to process records on the stream\. 



## Example 1: Process a Stream Using a 1\-Minute Sliding Window<a name="sliding-ex1"></a>

Consider the demo stream in the Getting Started exercise that populates the in\-application stream, `SOURCE_SQL_STREAM_001`\. The following is the schema\.

```
(TICKER_SYMBOL VARCHAR(4), 
 SECTOR varchar(16),
 CHANGE REAL,
 PRICE REAL)
```

Suppose that you want your application to compute aggregates using a sliding 1\-minute window\. That is, for each new record that appears on the stream, you want the application to emit an output by applying aggregates on records in the preceding 1\-minute window\.

You can use the following time\-based windowed query\. The query uses the `WINDOW` clause to define the 1\-minute range interval\. The `PARTITION BY` in the `WINDOW` clause groups records by ticker values within the sliding window\. 

```
SELECT STREAM ticker_symbol,
              MIN(Price) OVER W1 AS Min_Price,
              MAX(Price) OVER W1 AS Max_Price,
              AVG(Price) OVER W1 AS Avg_Price
FROM   "SOURCE_SQL_STREAM_001"
WINDOW W1 AS (
   PARTITION BY ticker_symbol 
   RANGE INTERVAL '1' MINUTE PRECEDING);
```

**To test the query**

1. Set up an application by following the [Getting Started Exercise](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/get-started-exercise.html)\.

1. Replace the `SELECT` statement in the application code with the preceding `SELECT` query\. The resulting application code is the following\.

   ```
   CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM "DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM" (
                            ticker_symbol VARCHAR(10), 
                            Min_Price     double, 
                            Max_Price     double, 
                            Avg_Price     double);
   CREATE OR REPLACE PUMP "STREAM_PUMP" AS 
      INSERT INTO "DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM"
        SELECT STREAM ticker_symbol,
                      MIN(Price) OVER W1 AS Min_Price,
                      MAX(Price) OVER W1 AS Max_Price,
                      AVG(Price) OVER W1 AS Avg_Price
        FROM   "SOURCE_SQL_STREAM_001"
        WINDOW W1 AS (
           PARTITION BY ticker_symbol 
           RANGE INTERVAL '1' MINUTE PRECEDING);
   ```

## Example 2: Query Applying Aggregates on a Sliding Window<a name="sliding-ex2"></a>

The following query on the demo stream returns the average of the percent change in the price of each ticker in a 10\-second window\.

```
SELECT STREAM Ticker_Symbol,
              AVG(Change / (Price - Change)) over W1 as Avg_Percent_Change
FROM "SOURCE_SQL_STREAM_001"
WINDOW W1 AS (
        PARTITION BY ticker_symbol 
        RANGE INTERVAL '10' SECOND PRECEDING);
```



**To test the query**

1. Set up an application by following the [Getting Started Exercise](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/get-started-exercise.html)\.

1. Replace the `SELECT` statement in the application code with the preceding `SELECT` query\. The resulting application code is the following\.

   ```
   CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM "DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM" (
                               ticker_symbol VARCHAR(10), 
                               Avg_Percent_Change double);
   CREATE OR REPLACE PUMP "STREAM_PUMP" AS 
      INSERT INTO "DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM"
         SELECT STREAM Ticker_Symbol,
                       AVG(Change / (Price - Change)) over W1 as Avg_Percent_Change
         FROM "SOURCE_SQL_STREAM_001"
         WINDOW W1 AS (
                 PARTITION BY ticker_symbol 
                 RANGE INTERVAL '10' SECOND PRECEDING);
   ```

## Example 3: Query Data from Multiple Sliding Windows on the Same Stream<a name="sliding-ex3"></a>

You can write queries to emit output in which each column value is calculated using different sliding windows defined over the same stream\. 

In the following example, the query emits the output ticker, price, a2, and a10\. It emits output for ticker symbols whose two\-row moving average crosses the ten\-row moving average\. The `a2` and `a10` column values are derived from two\-row and ten\-row sliding windows\.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM "DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM" (
                           ticker_symbol      VARCHAR(12), 
                           price              double, 
                           average_last2rows  double, 
                           average_last10rows double);

CREATE OR REPLACE PUMP "myPump" AS INSERT INTO "DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM"
SELECT STREAM ticker_symbol, 
              price, 
              avg(price) over last2rows, 
              avg(price) over last10rows
FROM SOURCE_SQL_STREAM_001
WINDOW
    last2rows AS (PARTITION BY ticker_symbol ROWS 2 PRECEDING),
    last10rows AS (PARTITION BY ticker_symbol ROWS 10 PRECEDING);
```

To test this query against the demo stream, follow the test procedure described in [Example 1](#sliding-ex1)\.

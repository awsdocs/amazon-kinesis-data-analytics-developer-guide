# Preprocessing Data Using a Lambda Function<a name="lambda-preprocessing"></a>

**Warning**  
For new projects, we recommend that you use the new Kinesis Data Analytics Studio over Kinesis Data Analytics for SQL Applications\. Kinesis Data Analytics Studio combines ease of use with advanced analytical capabilities, enabling you to build sophisticated stream processing applications in minutes\.

If the data in your stream needs format conversion, transformation, enrichment, or filtering, you can preprocess the data using an AWS Lambda function\. You can do this before your application SQL code executes or before your application creates a schema from your data stream\. 

Using a Lambda function for preprocessing records is useful in the following scenarios:
+ Transforming records from other formats \(such as KPL or GZIP\) into formats that Kinesis Data Analytics can analyze\. Kinesis Data Analytics currently supports JSON or CSV data formats\.
+ Expanding data into a format that is more accessible for operations such as aggregation or anomaly detection\. For instance, if several data values are stored together in a string, you can expand the data into separate columns\.
+ Data enrichment with other Amazon services, such as extrapolation or error correction\.
+ Applying complex string transformation to record fields\.
+ Data filtering for cleaning up the data\.

## Using a Lambda Function for Preprocessing Records<a name="lambda-preprocessing-use"></a>

When creating your Kinesis Data Analytics application, you enable Lambda preprocessing in the **Connect to a Source** page\.

**To use a Lambda function to preprocess records in a Kinesis Data Analytics application**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Kinesis Data Analytics console at [ https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/kinesisanalytics](https://console.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics)\.

1. On the **Connect to a Source** page for your application, choose **Enabled** in the **Record pre\-processing with AWS Lambda** section\.

1. To use a Lambda function that you have already created, choose the function in the **Lambda function** drop\-down list\.

1. To create a new Lambda function from one of the Lambda preprocessing templates, choose the template from the drop\-down list\. Then choose **View <template name> in Lambda** to edit the function\.

1. To create a new Lambda function, choose **Create new**\. For information about creating a Lambda function, see [Create a HelloWorld Lambda Function and Explore the Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started-create-function.html) in the *AWS Lambda Developer Guide*\.

1. Choose the version of the Lambda function to use\. To use the latest version, choose **$LATEST**\.

When you choose or create a Lambda function for record preprocessing, the records are preprocessed before your application SQL code executes or your application generates a schema from the records\.

## Lambda Preprocessing Permissions<a name="lambda-preprocessing-policy"></a>

To use Lambda preprocessing, the application's IAM role requires the following permissions policy:

```
     {
       "Sid": "UseLambdaFunction",
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Action": [
           "lambda:InvokeFunction",
           "lambda:GetFunctionConfiguration"
       ],
       "Resource": "<FunctionARN>"
   }
```

## Lambda Preprocessing Metrics<a name="lambda-preprocessing-metrics"></a>

You can use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the number of Lambda invocations, bytes processed, successes and failures, and so on\. For information about CloudWatch metrics that are emitted by Kinesis Data Analytics Lambda preprocessing, see [Amazon Kinesis Analytics Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/aka-metricscollected.html)\.

## Using AWS Lambda with the Kinesis Producer Library<a name="lambda-preprocessing-deaggregation"></a>

The [Kinesis Producer Library](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-kpl.html) \(KPL\) aggregates small user\-formatted records into larger records up to 1 MB to make better use of Amazon Kinesis Data Streams throughput\. The Kinesis Client Library \(KCL\) for Java supports deaggregating these records\. However, you must use a special module to deaggregate the records when you use AWS Lambda as the consumer of your streams\. 

To get the necessary project code and instructions, see the [Kinesis Producer Library Deaggregation Modules for AWS Lambda](https://github.com/awslabs/kinesis-deaggregation) on GitHub\. You can use the components in this project to process KPL serialized data within AWS Lambda in Java, Node\.js, and Python\. You can also use these components as part of a [multi\-lang KCL application](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/blob/master/amazon-kinesis-client-multilang/src/main/java/software/amazon/kinesis/multilang/package-info.java)\.

## Data Preprocessing Event Input Data Model/Record Response Model<a name="lambda-preprocessing-data-model"></a>

To preprocess records, your Lambda function must be compliant with the required event input data and record response models\. 

### Event Input Data Model<a name="lambda-preprocessing-request-model"></a>

Kinesis Data Analytics continuously reads data from your Kinesis data stream or Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream\. For each batch of records it retrieves, the service manages how each batch gets passed to your Lambda function\. Your function receives a list of records as input\. Within your function, you iterate through the list and apply your business logic to accomplish your preprocessing requirements \(such as data format conversion or enrichment\)\. 

The input model to your preprocessing function varies slightly, depending on whether the data was received from a Kinesis data stream or a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream\. 

If the source is a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream, the event input data model is as follows:

**Kinesis Data Firehose Request Data Model**


| Field | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| Field | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| Field | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| invocationId | The Lambda invocation Id \(random GUID\)\. | 
| applicationArn | Kinesis Data Analytics application Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) | 
| streamArn | Delivery stream ARN | 
| records [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/lambda-preprocessing.html)  | 
| recordId | record ID \(random GUID\) | 
| kinesisFirehoseRecordMetadata |  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/lambda-preprocessing.html)  | 
| data | Base64\-encoded source record payload | 
| approximateArrivalTimestamp | Delivery stream record approximate arrival time | 

The following example shows input from a Firehose delivery stream:

```
{
   "invocationId":"00540a87-5050-496a-84e4-e7d92bbaf5e2",
   "applicationArn":"arn:aws:kinesisanalytics:us-east-1:12345678911:application/lambda-test",
   "streamArn":"arn:aws:firehose:us-east-1:AAAAAAAAAAAA:deliverystream/lambda-test",
   "records":[
      {
         "recordId":"49572672223665514422805246926656954630972486059535892482",
         "data":"aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=",
         "kinesisFirehoseRecordMetadata":{
            "approximateArrivalTimestamp":1520280173
         }
      }
   ]
}
```

If the source is a Kinesis data stream, the event input data model is as follows:

**Kinesis Streams Request Data Model**


| Field | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| Field | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| Field | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| invocationId | The Lambda invocation Id \(random GUID\)\. | 
| applicationArn | Kinesis Data Analytics application ARN | 
| streamArn | Delivery stream ARN | 
| records [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/lambda-preprocessing.html)  | 
| recordId | record ID based off of Kinesis record sequence number | 
| kinesisStreamRecordMetadata |  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/lambda-preprocessing.html)  | 
| data | Base64\-encoded source record payload | 
| sequenceNumber | Sequence number from the Kinesis stream record | 
| partitionKey | Partition key from the Kinesis stream record | 
| shardId | ShardId from the Kinesis stream record | 
| approximateArrivalTimestamp | Delivery stream record approximate arrival time | 

The following example shows input from a Kinesis data stream:

```
{
  "invocationId": "00540a87-5050-496a-84e4-e7d92bbaf5e2",
  "applicationArn": "arn:aws:kinesisanalytics:us-east-1:12345678911:application/lambda-test",
  "streamArn": "arn:aws:kinesis:us-east-1:AAAAAAAAAAAA:stream/lambda-test",
  "records": [
    {
      "recordId": "49572672223665514422805246926656954630972486059535892482",
      "data": "aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=",
      "kinesisStreamRecordMetadata":{
            "shardId" :"shardId-000000000003",
            "partitionKey":"7400791606",
            "sequenceNumber":"49572672223665514422805246926656954630972486059535892482",
            "approximateArrivalTimestamp":1520280173
         }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Record Response Model<a name="lambda-preprocessing-response-model"></a>

All records returned from your Lambda preprocessing function \(with record IDs\) that are sent to the Lambda function must be returned\. They must contain the following parameters, or Kinesis Data Analytics rejects them and treats it as a data preprocessing failure\. The data payload part of the record can be transformed to accomplish preprocessing requirements\.

**Response Data Model**


| Field | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| records [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/lambda-preprocessing.html)  | 
| recordId | The record ID is passed from Kinesis Data Analytics to Lambda during the invocation\. The transformed record must contain the same record ID\. Any mismatch between the ID of the original record and the ID of the transformed record is treated as a data preprocessing failure\. | 
| result | The status of the data transformation of the record\. The possible values are: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/lambda-preprocessing.html)  | 
| data | The transformed data payload, after base64\-encoding\. Each data payload can contain multiple JSON documents if the application ingestion data format is JSON\. Or each can contain multiple CSV rows \(with a row delimiter specified in each row\) if the application ingestion data format is CSV\. The Kinesis Data Analytics service successfully parses and processes data with either multiple JSON documents or CSV rows within the same data payload\.  | 

The following example shows output from a Lambda function:

```
{
  "records": [
    {
      "recordId": "49572672223665514422805246926656954630972486059535892482",
      "result": "Ok",
      "data": "SEVMTE8gV09STEQ="
    }
  ]
}
```

## Common Data Preprocessing Failures<a name="lambda-preprocessing-failures"></a>

The following are common reasons why preprocessing can fail\.
+ Not all records \(with record IDs\) in a batch that are sent to the Lambda function are returned back to the Kinesis Data Analytics service\. 
+ The response is missing either the record ID, status, or data payload field\. The data payload field is optional for a `Dropped` or `ProcessingFailed` record\.
+ The Lambda function timeouts are not sufficient to preprocess the data\.
+ The Lambda function response exceeds the response limits imposed by the AWS Lambda service\.

For data preprocessing failures, Kinesis Data Analytics continues to retry Lambda invocations on the same set of records until successful\. You can monitor the following CloudWatch metrics to gain insight into failures\.
+ Kinesis Data Analytics application `MillisBehindLatest`: Indicates how far behind an application is reading from the streaming source\. 
+ Kinesis Data Analytics application `InputPreprocessing` CloudWatch metrics: Indicates the number of successes and failures, among other statistics\. For more information, see [Amazon Kinesis Analytics Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/aka-metricscollected.html)\.

# Tumbling Windows \(Aggregations Using GROUP BY\)<a name="tumbling-window-concepts"></a>

**Warning**  
For new projects, we recommend that you use the new Kinesis Data Analytics Studio over Kinesis Data Analytics for SQL Applications\. Kinesis Data Analytics Studio combines ease of use with advanced analytical capabilities, enabling you to build sophisticated stream processing applications in minutes\.

When a windowed query processes each window in a non\-overlapping manner, the window is referred to as a *tumbling window*\. In this case, each record on an in\-application stream belongs to a specific window\. It is processed only once \(when the query processes the window to which the record belongs\)\.

For example, an aggregation query using a `GROUP BY` clause processes rows in a tumbling window\. The demo stream in the [getting started exercise](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/get-started-exercise.html) receives stock price data that is mapped to the in\-application stream `SOURCE_SQL_STREAM_001` in your application\. This stream has the following schema\.

```
(TICKER_SYMBOL VARCHAR(4), 
 SECTOR varchar(16), 
 CHANGE REAL, 
 PRICE REAL)
```

In your application code, suppose that you want to find aggregate \(min, max\) prices for each ticker over a one\-minute window\. You can use the following query\.

```
SELECT STREAM ROWTIME,
              Ticker_Symbol,
              MIN(Price) AS Price,
              MAX(Price) AS Price
FROM     "SOURCE_SQL_STREAM_001"
GROUP BY Ticker_Symbol, 
         STEP("SOURCE_SQL_STREAM_001".ROWTIME BY INTERVAL '60' SECOND);
```

The preceding is an example of a windowed query that is time\-based\. The query groups records by `ROWTIME` values\. For reporting on a per\-minute basis, the `STEP` function rounds down the `ROWTIME` values to the nearest minute\. 

**Note**  
You can also use the `FLOOR` function to group records into windows\. However, `FLOOR` can only round time values down to a whole time unit \(hour, minute, second, and so on\)\. `STEP` is recommended for grouping records into tumbling windows because it can round values down to an arbitrary interval, for example, 30 seconds\.

This query is an example of a nonoverlapping \(tumbling\) window\. The `GROUP BY` clause groups records in a one\-minute window, and each record belongs to a specific window \(no overlapping\)\. The query emits one output record per minute, providing the min/max ticker price recorded at the specific minute\. This type of query is useful for generating periodic reports from the input data stream\. In this example, reports are generated each minute\. 

**To test the query**

1. Set up an application by following the [getting started exercise](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/get-started-exercise.html)\.

1. Replace the `SELECT` statement in the application code by the preceding `SELECT` query\. The resulting application code is shown following:

   ```
   CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM "DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM" (
                                      ticker_symbol VARCHAR(4), 
                                      Min_Price     DOUBLE, 
                                      Max_Price     DOUBLE);
   -- CREATE OR REPLACE PUMP to insert into output
   CREATE OR REPLACE PUMP "STREAM_PUMP" AS 
     INSERT INTO "DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM" 
       SELECT STREAM Ticker_Symbol,
                     MIN(Price) AS Min_Price,
                     MAX(Price) AS Max_Price
       FROM    "SOURCE_SQL_STREAM_001"
       GROUP BY Ticker_Symbol, 
                STEP("SOURCE_SQL_STREAM_001".ROWTIME BY INTERVAL '60' SECOND);
   ```

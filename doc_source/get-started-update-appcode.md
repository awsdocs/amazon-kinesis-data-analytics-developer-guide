# Step 3\.4: \(Optional\) Update the Application Code<a name="get-started-update-appcode"></a>

**Warning**  
For new projects, we recommend that you use the new Kinesis Data Analytics Studio over Kinesis Data Analytics for SQL Applications\. Kinesis Data Analytics Studio combines ease of use with advanced analytical capabilities, enabling you to build sophisticated stream processing applications in minutes\.

In this step, you explore how to update the application code\. 

**To update application code**

1. Create another in\-application stream as follows:
   + Create another in\-application stream called `DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM_2`\.
   + Create a pump, and then use it to insert rows in the newly created stream by selecting rows from the `DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM`\.

   In the SQL editor, append the following code to the existing application code:

   ```
   CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM "DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM_2" 
              (ticker_symbol VARCHAR(4), 
               change        DOUBLE, 
               price         DOUBLE);
   
   CREATE OR REPLACE PUMP "STREAM_PUMP_2" AS 
      INSERT INTO "DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM_2"
         SELECT STREAM ticker_symbol, change, price 
         FROM   "DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM";
   ```

   Save and run the code\. Additional in\-application streams appear on the **Real\-time analytics** tab\.

1. Create two in\-application streams\. Filter rows in the `SOURCE_SQL_STREAM_001` based on the stock ticker, and then insert them in to these separate streams\. 

   Append the following SQL statements to your application code:

   ```
   CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM "AMZN_STREAM" 
              (ticker_symbol VARCHAR(4), 
               change        DOUBLE, 
               price         DOUBLE);
   
   CREATE OR REPLACE PUMP "AMZN_PUMP" AS 
      INSERT INTO "AMZN_STREAM"
         SELECT STREAM ticker_symbol, change, price 
         FROM   "SOURCE_SQL_STREAM_001"
         WHERE  ticker_symbol SIMILAR TO '%AMZN%';
   
   CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM "TGT_STREAM" 
              (ticker_symbol VARCHAR(4), 
               change        DOUBLE, 
               price         DOUBLE);
   
   CREATE OR REPLACE PUMP "TGT_PUMP" AS 
      INSERT INTO "TGT_STREAM"
         SELECT STREAM ticker_symbol, change, price 
         FROM   "SOURCE_SQL_STREAM_001"
         WHERE  ticker_symbol SIMILAR TO '%TGT%';
   ```

   Save and run the code\. Notice additional in\-application streams on the **Real\-time analytics** tab\.

You now have your first working Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics application\. In this exercise, you did the following: 
+ Created your first Kinesis data analytics application\.

   
+ Configured application input that identified the demo stream as the streaming source and mapped it to an in\-application stream \(`SOURCE_SQL_STREAM_001`\) that is created\. Kinesis Data Analytics continuously reads the demo stream and inserts records in the in\-application stream\.

   
+ Your application code queried the `SOURCE_SQL_STREAM_001` and wrote output to another in\-application stream called `DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM`\. 



Now you can optionally configure application output to write the application output to an external destination\. That is, you can configure the application output to write records in the `DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM` to an external destination\. For this exercise, this is an optional step\. To learn how to configure the destination, go to the next step\.

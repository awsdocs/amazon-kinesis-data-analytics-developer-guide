# Overview of Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics Resources<a name="access-control-overview"></a>

**Warning**  
For new projects, we recommend that you use the new Kinesis Data Analytics Studio over Kinesis Data Analytics for SQL Applications\. Kinesis Data Analytics Studio combines ease of use with advanced analytical capabilities, enabling you to build sophisticated stream processing applications in minutes\.

To provide access, add permissions to your users, groups, or roles:
+ Users and groups in AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\):

  Create a permission set\. Follow the instructions in [Create a permission set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/howtocreatepermissionset.html) in the *AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\) User Guide*\.
+ Users managed in IAM through an identity provider:

  Create a role for identity federation\. Follow the instructions in [Creating a role for a third\-party identity provider \(federation\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.
+ IAM users:
  + Create a role that your user can assume\. Follow the instructions in [Creating a role for an IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.
  + \(Not recommended\) Attach a policy directly to a user or add a user to a user group\. Follow the instructions in [Adding permissions to a user \(console\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_change-permissions.html#users_change_permissions-add-console) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

**Note**  
An *account administrator* \(or administrator user\) is a user with administrator privileges\. For more information, see [IAM Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

## Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics Resources and Operations<a name="access-control-resources"></a>

In Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics, the primary resource is *an application*\. In a policy, you use an Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) to identify the resource that the policy applies to\.

These resources have unique Amazon Resource Names \(ARNs\) associated with them, as shown in the following table\. 


****  

| Resource Type | ARN Format | 
| --- | --- | 
| Application |  `arn:aws:kinesisanalytics:region:account-id:application/application-name`  | 

Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics provides a set of operations to work with Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics resources\. For a list of available operations, see Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics [Actions](API_Operations.md)\.

## Understanding Resource Ownership<a name="access-control-resource-ownership"></a>

The AWS account owns the resources that are created in the account, regardless of who created the resources\. Specifically, the resource owner is the AWS account of the [principal entity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html) \(that is, the root account, a user, or an IAM role\) that authenticates the resource creation request\. The following examples illustrate how this works:
+ If you use the root account credentials of your AWS account to create an application, your AWS account is the owner of the resource\. \(In Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics, the resource is an application\.\)
+ If you create a user in your AWS account and grant permissions to create an application to that user, the user can create an application\. However, your AWS account, to which the user belongs, owns the application resource\. We strongly recommend you grant permissions to roles and not users\.
+ If you create an IAM role in your AWS account with permissions to create an application, anyone who can assume the role can create an application\. Your AWS account, to which the user belongs, owns the application resource\. 

## Managing Access to Resources<a name="manage-access-overview"></a>

A *permissions policy* describes who has access to what\. The following section explains the available options for creating permissions policies\.

**Note**  
This section discusses using IAM in the context of Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics\. It doesn't provide detailed information about the IAM service\. For complete IAM documentation, see [What Is IAM?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\. For information about IAM policy syntax and descriptions, see [IAM JSON Policy Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

Policies that are attached to an IAM identity are referred to as *identity\-based* policies \(IAM policies\)\. Policies that are attached to a resource are referred to as *resource\-based* policies\. Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics supports only identity\-based policies \(IAM policies\)\.

### Identity\-Based Policies \(IAM Policies\)<a name="manage-access-iam-policies"></a>

You can attach policies to IAM identities\. For example, you can do the following:
+ **Attach a permissions policy to a user or a group in your account** – To grant a user permissions to create an Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics resource, such as an application, you can attach a permissions policy to a user or group that the user belongs to\.
+ **Attach a permissions policy to a role \(grant cross\-account permissions\)** – You can attach an identity\-based permissions policy to an IAM role to grant cross\-account permissions\. For example, the administrator in account A can create a role to grant cross\-account permissions to another AWS account \(for example, account B\) or an Amazon service as follows:

  1. Account A administrator creates an IAM role and attaches a permissions policy to the role that grants permissions on resources in account A\.

  1. Account A administrator attaches a trust policy to the role identifying account B as the principal who can assume the role\. 

  1. Account B administrator can then delegate permissions to assume the role to any users in account B\. Doing this allows users in account B to create or access resources in account A\. The principal in the trust policy can also be an Amazon service principal if you want to grant an Amazon service permissions to assume the role\.

  For more information about using IAM to delegate permissions, see [Access Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

The following is an example policy that grants permission for the `kinesisanalytics:CreateApplication `action, which is required to create an Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics application\.

**Note**  
This is an introductory example policy\. When you attach the policy to the user, the user will be able to create an application using the AWS CLI or AWS SDK\. But the user will need more permissions to configure input and output\. In addition, the user will need more permissions when using the console\. The later sections provide more information\.

            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "kinesisanalytics:CreateApplication"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

For more information about using identity\-based policies with Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics, see [Using Identity\-Based Policies \(IAM Policies\) for Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics](using-identity-based-policies.md)\. For more information about users, groups, roles, and permissions, see [Identities \(Users, Groups, and Roles\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\. 

### Resource\-Based Policies<a name="manage-access-resource-policies"></a>

Other services, such as Amazon S3, also support resource\-based permissions policies\. For example, you can attach a policy to an S3 bucket to manage access permissions to that bucket\. Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics doesn't support resource\-based policies\.

## Specifying Policy Elements: Actions, Effects, and Principals<a name="specify-policy-elements"></a>

For each Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics resource, the service defines a set of API operations\. To grant permissions for these API operations, Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics defines a set of actions that you can specify in a policy\. Some API operations can require permissions for more than one action in order to perform the API operation\. For more information about resources and API operations, see [Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics Resources and Operations](#access-control-resources) and Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics [Actions](API_Operations.md)\.

The following are the most basic policy elements:
+ **Resource** – You use an Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) to identify the resource that the policy applies to\. For more information, see [Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics Resources and Operations](#access-control-resources)\.
+ **Action** – You use action keywords to identify resource operations that you want to allow or deny\. For example, you can use `create` to allow users to create an application\.
+ **Effect** – You specify the effect, either allow or deny, when the user requests the specific action\. If you don't explicitly grant access to \(allow\) a resource, access is implicitly denied\. You can also explicitly deny access to a resource, which you might do to make sure that a user cannot access it, even if a different policy grants access\.
+ **Principal** – In identity\-based policies \(IAM policies\), the user that the policy is attached to is the implicit principal\. For resource\-based policies, you specify the user, account, service, or other entity that you want to receive permissions \(applies to resource\-based policies only\)\. Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics doesn't support resource\-based policies\.

To learn more about IAM policy syntax and descriptions, see [IAM JSON Policy Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

For a table showing all of the Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API operations and the resources that they apply to, see [Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API Permissions: Actions, Permissions, and Resources Reference](api-permissions-reference.md)\.

## Specifying Conditions in a Policy<a name="specifying-conditions-overview"></a>

When you grant permissions, you can use the access policy language to specify the conditions when a policy should take effect\. For example, you might want a policy to be applied only after a specific date\. For more information about specifying conditions in a policy language, see [Condition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements.html#Condition) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

To express conditions, you use predefined condition keys\. There are no condition keys specific to Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics\. However, there are AWS\-wide condition keys that you can use as appropriate\. For a complete list of AWS\-wide keys, see [Available Keys for Conditions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements.html#AvailableKeys) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

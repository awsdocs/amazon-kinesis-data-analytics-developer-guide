# Windowed Queries<a name="windowed-sql"></a>

**Warning**  
For new projects, we recommend that you use the new Kinesis Data Analytics Studio over Kinesis Data Analytics for SQL Applications\. Kinesis Data Analytics Studio combines ease of use with advanced analytical capabilities, enabling you to build sophisticated stream processing applications in minutes\.

SQL queries in your application code execute continuously over in\-application streams\. An in\-application stream represents unbounded data that flows continuously through your application\. Therefore, to get result sets from this continuously updating input, you often bound queries using a window defined in terms of time or rows\. These are also called *windowed SQL*\. 

For a time\-based windowed query, you specify the window size in terms of time \(for example, a one\-minute window\)\. This requires a timestamp column in your in\-application stream that is monotonically increasing\. \(The timestamp for a new row is greater than or equal to the previous row\.\) Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics provides such a timestamp column called `ROWTIME` for each in\-application stream\. You can use this column when specifying time\-based queries\. For your application, you might choose some other timestamp option\. For more information, see [Timestamps and the ROWTIME Column](timestamps-rowtime-concepts.md)\.

For a row\-based windowed query, you specify the window size in terms of the number of rows\.

You can specify a query to process records in a tumbling window, sliding window, or stagger window manner, depending on your application needs\. Kinesis Data Analytics supports the following window types:
+ [Stagger Windows](stagger-window-concepts.md): A query that aggregates data using keyed time\-based windows that open as data arrives\. The keys allow for multiple overlapping windows\. This is the recommended way to aggregate data using time\-based windows, because Stagger Windows reduce late or out\-of\-order data compared to Tumbling windows\.
+ [Tumbling Windows](tumbling-window-concepts.md): A query that aggregates data using distinct time\-based windows that open and close at regular intervals\.
+ [Sliding Windows](sliding-window-concepts.md): A query that aggregates data continuously, using a fixed time or rowcount interval\.
